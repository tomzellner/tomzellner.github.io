I'm a recent UC Berkeley Grad who majored in International Trade and Development. I spent my final semester working on my undergraduate Thesis. In doing so I gained valuable practice at formal and academic research at its most devolved and applicable manner. While the analysis of yam production in Jamaica or a historical narrative of the systematic regime change in Chile might not help me with my JavaScript Closures or Git Workflow, it has left me with the invaluable knowledge of learning how to learn and a comfortability with being left in charge of my continued education.

After finishing up my undergraduate studies at UC Berkeley I've decided to re-engage myself in my life-long passion for computers and technology as a whole. At Dev Bootcamp I had a realization that I could turn this passion into a fulfilling and engaging career.


Through the process of working on my thesis I realized I would need to find something else in the professional world if I wanted to stay as engaged and motivated as I was used to. Following my graduation I pivoted, joined Dev Bootcamp, and thoroughly enjoyed the challenges and accomplishments that have come along with becoming a Software Developer.
