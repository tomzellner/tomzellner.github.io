Stereotype Threat, let me tell you, its real. When I first got to DBC, I didn't know that there was a name for this but I can tell you first hand, I was feeling it. So what is it? and is it real? Basically stereotype threat is the feeling that you don't belong in any given situation that you find yourself in. Ever felt like you don't fit in because you fell through the cracks? That you're not good enough to be doing something that you've been assigned? Someone must have made a mistake and thought that you were better than you really were? Well the technical word for that is Stereotype threat. Simply put in a few words, you don't belong, because you are different in one way or another, from everybody else who is there. And because you don't belong, you can't do as well.


Well, forget about it, because, ITS NOT TRUE! Its just a physiological conundrum that your brain creates when you feel like you don't belong! And unfortunately, if you let yourself believe it, It can actually negatively affect you, reaffirming your fears. That's why you can't let it get to you. Chances are everybody feels the same way, at least to some degree. You got here, so you belong here! you are part of the 100%. 


Like I said earlier this was something that I was struggling with when I first started at DBC, and I guess still do at times. I'm definitely the one of the youngest here, having just graduated college; I don't belong. I had literally 0 coding/ webdev experience before starting here; I don't belong. I wasn't even a STEM major in college; I definitely don't belong! I had all these thoughts during the first few weeks of the program. I found the best way for me to get past these feelings was actually the opposite of what I thought would help. Working on group projects and in Guided Peering Sessions helped me realize despite my lack of experience and my age, I was able to keep up with everyone around me. The reality of it was we were all essentially starting from square one, especially with the perspective that computer programming can become a life-long learning experience. 


Six weeks in, I still get that feeling from time to time, especially if I'm working on a challenge and I get stuck. I'll head over to our PocketGophers Google+ page and see people are flying through that particular weeks challenges, and I'll feel like I'm getting left in the dust. The worst part about thinking those thoughts is that they just slow me down that much more, and definitely don't help me get the work done. I've always been able to figure everything out with enough effort, so I've begun realizing that I just need to push aside those thoughts; first of all they aren't even true, and all they are working to do is to slow me down.

I guess what I'm trying to say here, and I'm talking to all my fellow PocketGophers, we ALL belong here, so stop thinking otherwise. And apply that realization to other areas of your life too! Chances are, if your doing something, you are the right person for the job. Confidence is King!
