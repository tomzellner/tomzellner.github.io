Over the course of my scholastic career, my personal view on question asking has changed quite drastically. When I was a kid in grade school, and through out most of high school, I didnt really think if a question I wanted to ask was a good question. I was living by the laws of 'the only bad question is the question not asked', and while that is probably important for most young students to believe, Ive felt that I eventually out grew that logic. In the beginning of college, I developed a bad habit of never asking questions. Mostly because I was afraid of talking in larger classes, and confounding on that, I was afraid I would ask a 'bad' question and look silly

I was talking to guidance counselor about this at some point I think in my second year, and she gave me advise so simple and obvious I was honestly mad at first, but then I knew she was right. "Well then just make sure to think of a good question thats worth asking! Try writing one down on your notes to help you think it through" Ever since then I've tried to practice good question asking tendencies

In this brave new world of programming, Ive had tons of questions. Luckily hundreds if not thousands have had pretty similar questions. StackOverflow has become a super useful tool for me. I think now I've realized that asking a good question boiled down to figuring out how to efficiently ask a question using Google, so that I'll find an appropriate question thats already been answered somewhere on the Internet (usually it shows up on StackOverflow). I havnt yet asked my own question on StackOverflow, but I think after looking at so many others, I think I know what separates a good question from the bad ones. Luckily most of the questions Ive run into are the good ones, that have a lot of really solid answers.
