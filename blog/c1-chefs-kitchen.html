      I wouldn't say that my initial expectations or impressions of DevBootCamp have changed per-say, mostly because I haven't never been quite sure what to make of the whole experience. I originally heard about DBC from a friend who went through a NYC cohort, but my idea of the program from what he tried to explain to me totally changed when I did my own research a few months later online. Maybe changed is a bad word, because it didn't change in to anything, it was more akin to the understanding that I did have disappearing and not being quite sure what to make of it. This video helped me piece it all back together. Its not a tool or a means to an end, but rather it is what I as a student and what we as a cohort decide to make of it (which I am totally excited about because my fellow Pocket Gophers seem to be totally buying into the complete experience)
    <p>
        I am honestly pretty nervous about the entire DBC experience, more than I want to admit. This first week has been really good for me though, as a lot of those nerves have turned into excitement. I was afraid I was going to be miles behind the starting line, but it hasn't been that way at all, at least not yet! There definitely are people in my cohort who are much more experienced than me, but after this first week, and after watching Shereef's Fireside Chat, I'm coming to the conclusion that its not really going to be a problem that I'm starting from a different place than others in my cohort. In fact it might even be a good thing. Plus I've realized I'm not quite so far behind as I thought, and there are others right there with me.

        This first week has totally gotten me excited to keep going. I'm looking forward to seeing what else I can learn throughout the rest of phase0, but now I seriously cant wait for phase1 to start and to begin working face to face with such excellent people everyday for 9 weeks, teachers and fellow Gophers alike. The best part is, everyone seems to just as excited as me, or maybe even more excited. Others are nervous too, but I think we've all realized that we all feel nervous for mostly the same reasons, and I think thats helped us all realize that we signed up for DBC for similar reasons, and are all motivated and excited to see what we can make of this.
