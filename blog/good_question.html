  <h1>Asking a Good Question </h1>

    <p>
    Over the course of my scholastic career, my personal view on question asking has changed quite drastically. When I was a kid in grade school, and through out most of high school, I didnt really think if a question I wanted to ask was a good question. I was living by the laws of 'the only bad question is the question not asked', and while that is probably important for most young students to believe, Ive felt that I eventually out grew that logic. In the beginning of college, I developed a bad habit of never asking questions. Mostly because I was afraid of talking in larger classes, and confounding on that, I was afraid I would ask a 'bad' question and look silly

    I was talking to guidance counselor about this at some point I think in my second year, and she gave me advise so simple and obvious I was honestly mad at first, but then I knew she was right. "Well then just make sure to think of a good question thats worth asking! Try writing one down on your notes to help you think it through" Ever since then I've tried to practice good question asking tendencies

    <p> In this brave new world of programming, Ive had tons of questions. Luckily hundreds if not thousands have had pretty similar questions. StackOverflow has become a super useful tool for me. I think now I've realized that asking a good question boiled down to figuring out how to efficiently ask a question using Google, so that I'll find an appropriate question thats already been answered somewhere on the Internet (usually it shows up on StackOverflow). I havnt yet asked my own question on StackOverflow, but I think after looking at so many others, I think I know what separates a good question from the bad ones. Luckily most of the questions Ive run into are the good ones, that have a lot of really solid answers.
